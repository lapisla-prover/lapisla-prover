# How to Write a Proof

In this page, we will see how to write a formal proof in Lapisla.

## Concepts

First, let's see some basic concepts in Lapisla.

In Lapisla, we write proofs by applying **rules** to **goals**.

A **goal** (or sometimes a subgoal when it is one of some goals) is a sequent that is meant to be proved. A sequent is a pair of a sequence of formulas, written as $P_1, \ldots, P_n \vdash Q_1, \ldots, Q_m$. You can think the "meaning" of a sequent as "if all of $P_1, \ldots, P_n$ are true, then at least one of $Q_1, \ldots, Q_m$ is true." We sometimes use a greek letter (mostly $\Gamma$ or $\Delta$) to represent a sequence of formulas, like $\Gamma, A \vdash B$.

A **rule** is a step that transforms a sequent into some simpler sequents. Rules are always applied to the first subgoal. For example, the rule `AndR` transforms $\Gamma \vdash P \land Q, \Delta$ into $\Gamma \vdash P, \Delta$ and $\Gamma \vdash Q, \Delta$. If a sequent is completely broken down into the sequent $A \vdash A$ for some $A$, we can mark it as done and remove it from subgoals by applying the rule `I`.

Rules are described in the form

```math
\frac{\Gamma_1 \vdash \Delta_1 \quad \cdots \quad \Gamma_n \vdash \Delta_n}{\Gamma \vdash \Delta} \text{(\textit{RuleName})}
```

which means that from $\Gamma_1 \vdash \Delta_1, \ldots, \Gamma_n \vdash \Delta_n$, we can derive $\Gamma \vdash \Delta$ (note that $n$ can be zero). In other words, if we want to derive $\Gamma \vdash \Delta$, it is sufficient to derive $\Gamma_1 \vdash \Delta_1, \ldots, \Gamma_n \vdash \Delta_n$. That is, we can transform the goal $\Gamma \vdash \Delta$ into subgoals $\Gamma_1 \vdash \Delta_1, \ldots, \Gamma_n \vdash \Delta_n$.

For all rules, see [All Available Rules](/reference/rules).

A **proof** of a formula $P$ is a sequence of rules that breaks down the initial goal $\vdash P$ into trivial sequents. If we erased all of subgoals, we can say that $P$ is proved and call it a theorem!

A proof of $P$ can be seen as connecting rules in a tree with root $\vdash P$ (see the example below).

Once you proved a theorem, it can be used in other proofs by putting it in the left-hand side of the current goal with free predicate variables substituted. This operation is justified by the fact that we can construct a proof without using another theorem.

## Example

Before seeing more explanations, let's see an example of a proof in Lapisla.

Here is an example from previous page:

```lapisla
Theorem and_comm P ∧ Q → Q ∧ P
    apply ImpR
    apply AndR
    apply AndL2
    apply I
    apply AndL1
    apply I
qed
```

We will look at this proof line by line.

At the first line, we declare that we are going to prove the formula $P \land Q \to Q \land P$ named `and_comm`. The goal is $\vdash P \land Q \to Q \land P$.

At the second line, we apply the rule `ImpR` to the goal. It transforms the goal into $P \land Q \vdash Q \land P$.

At the third line, we apply the rule `AndR` to the goal. It splits the goal into two subgoals $P \land Q \vdash Q$ and $P \land Q \vdash P$.

At the fourth line, we apply the rule `AndL2` to the first subgoal. It transforms the subgoal into $Q \vdash Q$.

At the fifth line, the current goal is $Q \vdash Q$, so we can apply the rule `I` to conclude it.

Similarly, at the sixth and seventh lines, we make the goal $P \vdash P$ and mark it as completed.

Then, there are no subgoals left, so the proof is completed. By executing command `qed{:lapisla}`, we declare that the theorem `and_comm` is proved!

This proof creates the proof tree

```math
\dfrac{
  \dfrac{\dfrac{}{Q \vdash Q} \mathrlap{\text{(I)}}}{P \land Q \vdash Q} \text{(AndL2)}
  \quad \dfrac{\dfrac{}{P \vdash P} \mathrlap{\text{(I)}}}{P \land Q \vdash P} \mathrlap{\text{(AndL1)}}
}{\dfrac{ P \land Q \vdash Q \land P }{\vdash P \land Q \to Q \land P} \mathrlap{\text{(ImpR)}}} \text{(AndR)}
```

which shows "how the initial goal is broken down into simpler sequents" or "how the proof is constructed from primitive sequents".

## Commands

In Lapisla, every file consists of a sequence of commands. Each of them can be used in only one of **declare mode** or **proof mode**.

### Declare Mode

#### `Theorem`

```lapisla
Theorem name formula
```

```lapisla filename="example"
Theorem eq_sym ∀x. ∀y. (eq(x, y) → eq(y, x))
```

Declares a theorem `name` with the formula `formula`. Enter proof mode with the goal $\vdash \text{formula}$.

#### `import`

```lapisla
import "snapshot"
```

```lapisla filename="example"
import "zer0-star/equality@6"
```

Imports theorems, axioms and constants from another file. Currently only importing from snapshots on Lapisla registry is supported. The format is `username/repository@version`.

#### `axiom`

```lapisla
axiom name: formula
```

```lapisla filename="example"
axiom eq_refl: ∀x. eq(x, x)
```

Introduce a new axiom `name` with the formula `formula`. Axioms are like theorems, but instead of proving them, you assume them to be true. Be careful not to make system inconsistent!


#### `constant`

```lapisla
constant name: type
```

```lapisla filename="example"
constant eq: 'a → 'a → prop
```

Introduce a new constant `name` with the type `type`. With axioms, you can define some mathematical objects and its properties.

For example, you can define equality

```lapisla filename="abap34/eqdef.l"
constant eq: 'a → 'a → prop
axiom eq_refl: ∀x. eq(x, x)
axiom eq_subst: ∀x. ∀y. (eq(x, y) → P(x) → P(y))
```

and prove symmetry of equality like

```lapisla filename="zer0-star/equality.l"
import "abap34/eqdef@2"

Theorem eq_sym ∀x. ∀y. (eq(x, y) → eq(y, x))
  apply ForallR x1
  apply ForallR y1
  apply ImpR
  use eq_subst { P(x) ↦ eq(x, x1) }
  apply ForallL x1
  apply ForallL y1
  apply ImpL
  apply PR 1
  apply WR
  apply I 
  apply ImpL 
  apply WL
  apply PR 1
  apply WR
  use eq_refl 
  apply ForallL x1 
  apply I 
  apply PL 1
  apply WL
  apply I
qed
```

### Proof Mode

#### `apply`

```lapisla
apply rule
```

```lapisla filename="example"
apply ForallR x1
```

Applies `rule` to the current goal.

See [Rule Syntax](/reference/rules#rule-syntax).

#### `use`

```lapisla
use theorem { P1(x1, y1, …) ↦ A1, P2(x2, y2, …) ↦ A2, … }
```

```lapisla filename="example"
use forall_or { P(x) ↦ P(f(x)) ∨ Q, Q ↦ ∀x. P(x) }
```

Puts `theorem` applied with the given substitutions into the current goal. Note that all substitutions are applied simultaneously and not recursively, namely, if any of `A1`, `A2`, … contains some of `P1`, `P2`, …, they are not substituted.

A substitution `P(x, y, …) ↦ A` means that every occurrence of `P(s, t, …)` with free `P` in `theorem` is replaced by `A[x := s, y := t, …]`.

For example, execute `use forall_or { P(x) ↦ P(f(x)), Q ↦ A ∨ B }{:lapisla}` with `forall_or: ∀x. (P(x) ∨ Q) → ∀x. P(x) ∨ Q{:lapisla}`, you will get `∀x.(P(f(x)) ∨ (A ∨ B)) → ∀x.P(f(x)) ∨ (A ∨ B){:lapisla}`.

Substitutions can be omitted if you don't need to substitute anything. For example, `use eq_refl{:lapisla}` is valid.

#### `qed`

```lapisla
qed
```

Check if there is no goals left and finish the proof. Enter declare mode.

Every theorem should end with `qed{:lapisla}`.
