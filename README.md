## Motivation

Existing theorem proving assistant systems are often considered challenging compared to "general-purpose" software development.  

This is because while popular programming languages enjoy a highly developed ecosystem, active user communities, and a vast array of reusable programs, many theorem proving assistant systems lack such infrastructure.  

We aim to solve this problem by creating a fully browser-based kernel, user interface (UI), and registry.  

**lapisla** is software for everyone!  

## lapisla-kernel

The **lapisla** kernel is based on sequent calculus and is heavily inspired by [claire](https://github.com/myuon/claire).  

The kernel resides under [packages/kernel](packages/kernel) 

## lapisla-webui

**lapisla** comes with a custom-built web UI that delivers a development experience as seamless as working locally!  

The web UI can be found under [apps/web](apps/web) 

## lapisla-registry

**lapisla** features user management and registry functionalities.  
The backend, including the registry, can be found under [apps/api](apps/api)
